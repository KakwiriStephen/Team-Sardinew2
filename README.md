A platform that allows users create feedback forms to be embedded on their platforms


## Structure

| Codebase              |      Description          |
| :-------------------- | :-----------------------: |
| [Frontend](frontend)        |  React  |

## Branches

- **dev** -> Make Pull Request on this branch for everything both (`frontend` & `backend`) 
- **main** -> **dont touch** this branch, this is what is running in production.

## Contributions

feedback_gen is open to contributions, but we recommend creating an issue or replying in a comment to let us know what you are working on first that way we don't overwrite each other.

> *Sample Commit Messages*
- `chore: Updated README file` := `chore` is used because the commit didn't make any changes to the backend, frontend or test folders in any way.
- `feat: Added plugin info endpoints` := `feat` is used here because the feature was non-existent before the commit.
